# Hi there âœ‹!

#### Need for bootloader in Controllers:
                There is no need for bootloaders for our personal applications in microcontrollers.
But when we are developing a product where it will have further updates and future upgradations,
every time we cannot connect JTAG/ST-Link based system for the product for multiple customers
right , having a bootloader solves the issue then you don't need a debugger or flasher for 
flashing the firmware. This will also reduce the security threats if someone tries to configure
or hack the system this kind of vulnerabilities will also reduce.
